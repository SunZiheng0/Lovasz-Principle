# Lovasz-Principle
Lov√°sz Principle for Unsupervised Graph Representation Learning

Lovasz principle is actually a loss function. This loss function finds utility in all graph learning models, including examples like InfoGraph [3]. 

To illustrate, we provide the code of applying Lovasz principle on InfoGraph [3]. By substituting the original InfoMax loss with the Lovasz loss function. we establish an InfoGraph framework guided by the Lovasz principle. 
Importantly, the Lovasz principle's applicability isn't confined to any specific GNN model or graph data; rather, it offers a versatile approach across various contexts. Its generality is parallel to that of the InfoMax principle.
